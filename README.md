SplatNet 3 Scraper
==================

**SplatNet 3 Scraper** is a Python library for scraping data from the Splatoon 3 SplatNet 3 API. It is designed to be as lightweight as possible, with minimal dependencies to make it easy to integrate into other projects.

**SplatNet 3 Scraper** started as a fork of **[s3s](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s)**, but has since been rewritten from scratch while incorporating much of the login flow logic of s3s. As a result, I am deeply indebted to the authors of s3s for their work. This project would not have been possible without their efforts.

Requires Python 3.10 or later.
